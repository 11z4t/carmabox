"""CARMA Box — Savings Calculator.

Pure Python. No HA imports. Fully testable.

Calculates estimated monthly savings from:
1. Peak reduction (Ellevio top-3 weighted peaks × kr/kW)
2. Price optimization (discharge at expensive hours, charge at cheap)

All values are accumulated over the current month and reset on month change.
